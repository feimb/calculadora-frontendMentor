## Overview
A calculator that, in addition to allowing you to perform basic arithmetic operations, handles errors, changes according to your computer's theme, and saves another theme to local storage if you wish.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
